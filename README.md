# Leetcode-501-EASY-Tree
It almost drove me crazy!!!!!!! I wrote a lot but there is always some bugs! I guess this is the worst time we have learning CS!! Back to the topic, it is a not hard binary tree problem, but it requires some dictionary stuff, so people like me who are not familiar with dics, it will be a problem
